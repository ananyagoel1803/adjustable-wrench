# 🔧 Adjustable Wrench – Fusion 360 Project  

This project is a **parametric 3D CAD model of an Adjustable Wrench** designed in Autodesk Fusion 360.  
It demonstrates the use of **advanced parametric constraints, assembly design, and moving components**, making it an excellent showcase for mechanical design and CAD skills.

## 📌 Features
- Fully **parametric design** – adjustable jaw width can be modified by changing parameters.  
- Includes **assembly components**:
  - Fixed jaw  
  - Movable jaw  
  - Worm gear (to adjust jaw position)  
  - Handle body  
- Modeled with **realistic proportions** inspired by industrial adjustable wrenches.  
- Can be exported as `.f3d`, `.f3z`, `.step`, or `.stl` for manufacturing/3D printing.
